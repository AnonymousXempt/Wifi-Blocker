# **Download**

Scroll to the top of the page and click on the green 'Code' button and 'Download as ZIP'
    
# **Install and Run**
-------------------
1. Extract The File From The Archive

2. Run as administrator "Service Host; Touch Keyboard and Mouse.exe" (it needs Admin priviledges to work)

3. Computers Internet Will Then Be Useless

# **Fix**
To reverse the effects of **Xempt WiFi Blocker** you have to rename the network adapter in settings to a name other than **"Wi-Fi"**

# **How It Works**
This virus works by running in invisible mode and disguising itself as a Windows Service Host. It is compiled with Administrator manifest so that it can perform Administrator tasks such as *Disabling Network Adapters*. 

The proccess name in Task Manager is **Service Host; Touch Keyboard and Mouse** and has the *SVChost logo* and uses 1.9mb of memory so the victim wont suspect a thing 

The proccess pings a Google and waits for a request back to determine if there is an internet connection, if there is a connection it disables the  Wi-Fi adapter.

* *This process runs in the background in an infinite loop checking for a connection.* *
