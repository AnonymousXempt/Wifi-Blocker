# **Download**

Scroll to the top of the page and click on the green 'Code' button and 'Download as ZIP'
    
# **Install and Run**
-------------------
1.  Extract The File From The Archive

2.  Run as administrator "Service Host; Touch Keyboard and Mouse.exe" (it needs Admin priviledges to work)

3.  Computers Internet Will Then Be Useless


# **How It Works**
- This virus works by running in invisible mode and disguising itself as a Windows Service Host. It is compiled with Administrator manifest so that it can perform Administrator   tasks such as *Disabling Network Adapters*. 

- The proccess name in Task Manager is **Service Host; Touch Keyboard and Mouse** and has the *SVChost logo* and uses 1.9mb of memory so the victim wont suspect a thing. 

- The proccess pings a Google server and waits for a request back from the server to determine if there is an internet connection, if it returns back TRUE then the proccess       disables the  Wi-Fi adapter.

# **Fix**
- To reverse the effects of **Xempt WiFi Blocker** you have to rename the network adapter in settings to a name other than **"Wi-Fi"** or open task manager and end the proccess as well as any *Console Windows Host*

- ***This process runs in the background in a constant loop checking for a connection.***
